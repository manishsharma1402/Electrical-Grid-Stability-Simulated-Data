# Electrical-Grid-Stability-Simulated-Data-
Applied Decision tree and Logistic regression for classification into stable and unstable system using features provided in Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Data Data Set dataset.
 
On partitioning data into 70-30 training validation split the accuracy is reported on validation set.
Logistic regression is most efficient after Decision tree which learns the rules to give 100% accuracy while multilayer perceptron although better than guess is struggling to find the pattern in the data.
